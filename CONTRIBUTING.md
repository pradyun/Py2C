So, if you have a deadly idea and just can't wait to put it in code, well 
here's what you can do:

 1. Fork the repo.
 2. Create a new branch on your fork. Keeping the master branch clean seems
    like a nice idea to me. (It's not necessary though)
 3. Run the tests and make sure they all pass. 
    (If they don't, file an issue and continue)
 4. Make sure you have tests for your what you want the stuff to end up like.
 5. Start your work. Put that idea into code.
 6. Make those tests pass.
 7. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on me. I'll try to, at the very least, comment on 
the pull request as soon as I can. I may suggest some changes or improvements
or alternatives.

Ooh.. And yes, a bunch of things that I would like to mention:

 - Pull requests are awesome!
 - Tests are lovely once they are written. So, write them! 
 - PEP-8 has served me well as the Coding style guideline. Please try to stick 
   to it.

And in case I didn't emphasize enough: **I love tests!!**
